# Road-Accident-Dashboard

This interactive dashboard, created from Google Sheets data, provides insights into road accident statistics. The dashboard offers a variety of visualizations to explore different aspects of road accidents, including:
Total number of casualties by car type (fatal, serious, slight)
Breakdown of casualties by vehicle type (cars, motorbikes, etc.)
Casualties by factors like road surface, location (urban or rural), and light conditions
Monthly trends for current year vs previous years
Users can filter data by accident date and area.

# Technical details : 

This dashboard was likely created using Microsoft Execl.
The specific tools or languages used would depend on the functionality of the dashboard and your coding preferences.

   # Temporal Trends: 
   The dashboard allows for filtering by accident date, but it does not show any specific trends over time. You could add a feature to the dashboard that visualizes monthly or yearly trends in casualties.
